# PDDFA (Plant Disease Detection And Faramer Asistant)

## Overview

The agricultural industries are among the most significant industries. The Plant Disease Detection is capable of predicting the type of disease and identifying the best treatment. However, the individual eye is not well-equipped to identify the plant disease as like as the agricultural expert. Even disease is detected, finding the optimal treatment among the thousands of fertilizers and agricultural medicines is a challenging task. In addition, the individual may not know where the medicines will be available.

Our goal is to develop a plant disease detection system that utilizes a subfield of artificial intelligence known as computer vision to solve this issue. This proposed system can predict plant disease by comparing the image of plant and which in the database. With its non-invasive method, on-site disease detection can be performed in real-time without the need for destructive sampling. The model database has photos of various infected plants, and the system will attempt to identify the disease and recommend the best treatment. The system utilizes an algorithm to analyze and process the captured image to classify the plant disease. Moreover, the system is user-friendly application that perform farmer plant disease detection by either using phone camera or captured image with capability to suggest the agricultural shop where the medicines will be available. This solution aims to provide a versatile, scalable, and approach to plant disease detection, and contributing to the broader goal of farmer plant assistant.

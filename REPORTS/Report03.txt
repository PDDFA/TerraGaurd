Members:  Ahmad Ilawa, Mohammad Nassar, Ahmad Qassam



Topics Discussed:
Discuss about the methylogies  and technics about the project 



Decisions Made:
Project Techniques Overview:

Preprocessing:

Resize: Adjust the dimensions of images to a standardized size.
Color Change (Histogram Equalization): Enhance image contrast and detail through histogram equalization, specifically focusing on HSI (Hue, Saturation, Intensity) color space.
Normalize: Standardize pixel values to facilitate consistent input for subsequent processing.

CNN for Image Processing:

Utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to process preprocessed images for effective image detection.
Implement CNN architecture designed to handle images with a fixed size of 420x420 pixels.



Tasks Assigned:

research about the CNN and preprocessing technics
